# About the data contained in this folder:

1) The cartography (the file _shapes.geojson_) for the census tracts comes from the Cartographic and Geologic Institute of Catalonia (see [here](https://www.icgc.cat/en/Geoinformation-and-Maps/Data-and-products/Cartographic-geoinformation/Census-sections)), and is presented here after a format transformation from _shapefile_ to _geoJSON_.
2) All the statistical data for the census tracts comes from the Statistical Institute of Catalonia (see [here](https://www.idescat.cat/?lang=en)), and is condensed in the _ddbb.csv_ file.
3) The names for the census tracts do not correspond to any official administrative division. Where possible, the names are based on the neighborhoods designated by the city council, but elsewhere, names have been assigned based on landmarks and/or toponyms.
4) The _topicDictionary.csv_ file shows the correspondance between the _id_ given to each topic in the _HTML_ code.
